After that we went to the caves and the natural pedicure pool that was an experience!! Finally we visited the natural pool it was so amazing with all the fish trapped from the waves crashing over the walls.",

Took the tour our first day, it was worth it. Rode through the national park, saw all the sights, and got a history of the island. It is an early trip, but it takes you to incredible places. Snorkeled in Conchi, saw the native people's cave drawings, and finished with a great lunch! ",
